;;; Commentary:

;; This package is meant to be destroyed.  Delete the Lisp.  Delete the tests.
;; Create a new world for yourself.  Publish.  The commands contained here will
;; download the repo and perform renaming and relicensing.  As you may have
;; downloaded this package from MELPA, and as you have witnessed the CI passing,
;; you should already unsterstand that you have walked across the bridge.  The
;; license header checks will ensure that whatever Lisp you write or any
;; contributions it attracts may well end up in the Emacs core.

;;; Code:

(require 'dash) ; see flake.nix for providing dependencies for CI and local development.
